# End Users

This documentation is primarily intended for **developers, operators, and contributors** working with the eQual framework.

If you are an **end user** — someone using an application built with eQual — you are likely looking for the **documentation of that specific application**, not the framework itself.

## Why?

eQual is a development framework used to build many different applications.  
Each application has its own:

- User interface
- Features
- Workflows
- User guides

Because of this, there is no single universal end-user manual for eQual.

## What should you do?

Please refer to:

- The documentation or help center of the application you are using
- Your organization’s internal guides
- The application support team or administrator
