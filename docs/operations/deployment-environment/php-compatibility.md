# PHP Versions compatibility 

### Preferred PHP Version

The preferred PHP version is always the latest official version supported by the PHP community.

## Testing and Support

Testing and support are consistently provided for the current PHP version and the two previous PHP versions (n-2). 

This ensures backward compatibility and facilitates the identification of potential breaking changes as they arise.
