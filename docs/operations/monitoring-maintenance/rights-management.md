## Rights Management Utilities

The `AccessController` service and the `Permission` class provide the foundation for managing rights in eQual. These utilities allow administrators to configure and monitor access control effectively.

### Key Features:

- Assign rights to users and groups.
- Manage permissions using binary masks.
- Override default behavior with custom logic.

More on how these utilities work and how to use them can be found in the [ACL documentation](../../application-developpers/core-development-guide/models/authorization/access-control-lists.md) or in the [Rights Management utilities documentation](./rights-management-utilities.md).
