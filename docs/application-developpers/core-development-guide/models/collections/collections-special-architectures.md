# Special Dataset Architectures: Trees and Maps

## Tree Structures

Collections make it easy to represent data in a tree-like structure by pre-loading related objects and building hierarchical relationships. This is particularly useful for:

- Displaying hierarchical data in the UI.

- Refreshing only parts of the tree that have changed.

### Best Practices for Trees

- Limit the depth of the tree to prevent performance issues.

- Use front-end logic to optimize UI updates.

## Maps

For large datasets, collections can be structured as associative arrays (key-value pairs) or graph-like data. This approach simplifies:

- Efficient lookups.

- Updates and navigation.

- Handling complex datasets in the front-end.
