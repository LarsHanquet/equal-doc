* Renders the same switch UI, but it is always set to `readonly` (disabled), preventing user interaction.
* No event handlers for value changes are attached.

## Text

| **PROPERTY** | **TYPE** | **DESCRIPTION**                                                      |

## Select

Select widgets render a dropdown menu for selecting a value from a predefined list of options.

| **PROPERTY** | **TYPE**  | **DESCRIPTION**                                                         |

**View Mode:**

### Color Selection

When the `usage` property contains `color`, the select widget includes color indicators next to the selected value and each option in the dropdown, or in the plain text.

## String

String-based widgets (e.g., `string`, `text`, `label`) support all styling properties, allowing for rich text formatting and visual customization. This is the default widget type. 

By default, using a `string` widget provides you with a customizable String Widget. However, if `usage` contains `color`, it interprets this as a request to present a color selection widget. This creates a Select Widget with predefined color options (such as "lavender", "antiquewhite", "moccasin", etc.). For more on the Select Widget, see the [Select Widget Section](#select-widgets).

| **PROPERTY** | **TYPE**  | **DESCRIPTION**                                                         |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selection`  | `string`  | The initially selected value for the select dropdown.                   |
| `heading`    | `boolean` | If `true`, emphasizes the item with larger text (only for "form" views) |

**Edit Mode vs View Mode**

String widgets' vizual representation change wether the view is in edit mode or not.

**Edit Mode:**

* Renders an input field for text entry, or a select dropdown if a selection is provided in the config.
* The input field is interactive, allowing users to modify the value directly within the view.
* Event handlers are attached to handle value changes and focus events.
* In list layout, the input's width is adjusted for better fit.

**View Mode:** 

* Renders a non-editable dsplay of the value.
* In list layout, if the usage is `phone` or `email`, the value is rendered as clickable links (`tel:` for phone numbers and `mailto:` for emails).
* In other cases, the value is shown as plain text or using a styled input view for non-list layouts.
* Additional styling and title attributes are applied for display purposes.

### Icon Naming

String widgets allow for a flexible approach to icon representation. If the `usage` property contains the keywords `icon` or `symbol`, the widget will attempt to map the string value to a corresponding Material icon. 

| **Value Keyword** | **Description**                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success`         | Displays a green check circle icon, indicating success or completion.               |
| `info`            | Displays a blue info icon, indicating informational content.                        |
| `warn`            | Displays an orange warning icon, indicating a cautionary message.                   |
| `major`           | Displays an orangered error icon, indicating a major issue.                         |
| `important`       | Displays an orangered error icon, indicating important information.                 |
| `error`           | Displays a red report icon, indicating an error or problem.                         |
| `paid`            | Displays a green paid icon, indicating a successful payment.                        |
| `due`             | Displays a red money_off icon, indicating an outstanding payment.                   |
| `valid`           | Displays a green check circle icon, indicating validity.                            |
| `invalid`         | Displays a red error icon, indicating invalidity.                                   |
| `for`             | Displays a green thumb_up icon, indicating support or agreement.                    |
| `against`         | Displays a red thumb_down icon, indicating opposition or disagreement.              |
| `abstain`         | Displays a grey remove icon, indicating abstention.                                 |
| `folder`          | Displays a folder icon with a specific color, indicating a directory or collection. |
| `file`            | Displays a grey description icon, indicating a file.                                |
| `document`        | Displays a grey description icon, indicating a document.                            |
| `full`            | Displays a green circle icon, indicating completeness.                              |
| `part`            | Displays an orange adjust icon, indicating partial completion.                      |
| `none`            | Displays a red radio_button_unchecked icon, indicating absence or null value.       |

If the value does not match any key in the mapping, it simply displays the value as a Material icon.

**Example:** If the value of the field is "success", the widget will render a green check circle icon. If the value is "folder", it will render a folder icon with a specific color. If the value is "unknown", it will attempt to render an icon named "unknown" from the Material icons set, and if that doesn't exist, it will display the text "unknown".

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "usage": "icon",
  "field": "status",
  "label": "Status"
}
```
