## Joining the Project

Active committers and contributors are invited to introduce themselves and request commit access to the project on the Discord [#join](https://discord.com/invite/xNAXyhbYBp) channel. If you think you can help, we'd love to have you!

## First-time Contributors

There are always a few issues tagged [Good first issues](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/labels/good%20first%20issue) to make it easy to get started.

If you're interested in working on an issue:

* Make sure it has either a `good-first-issue` label added.
* Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it (this helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues).

## Bugs and Issues

Please report these on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/issues). Please do not use issues for support requests: for help using eQual, please consider Stack Overflow.

Well-structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.

Guidelines for reporting bugs:

* Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported.
* Isolate the problem to a simple test case.
* Please include a code snippet that demonstrates the bug. If filing a bug against master, you may reference the latest code using the URL of the repository of the branch (e.g. [https://github.com/equalframework/equal/blob/master/eq.lib.php](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/blob/master/eq.lib.php) - changing the filename to point at the file you need as appropriate).
* Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it's generic or only happens with a certain configuration or data set.
