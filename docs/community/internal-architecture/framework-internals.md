# Directory structure

The directory structure of the eQual framework is designed for simplicity and efficiency, providing a clear organization that enhances the development process.

## Root directory structure

```
/
├── bin
├── lib
├── packages
├── public
│   ├── .htaccess
│   └── index.php
├── spool
├── eq.lib.php
└── run.php
```

| **FILE** | **DESCRIPTION** |
|-|-|
| `eq.lib.php`	| Bootstrap library. Defines constants and global utilities. |
| `run.php`	| Server script for client-server mode. |
| `lib`	      | Folder containing the eQual library (mostly classes and services definitions). |
| `packages` | Folder containing installed packages (class definitions, translations, views, actions, etc.). |
| `public` | Root public folder for the web server. |
| `bin` | Folder containing values of binary fields (see `BINARY_STORAGE_DIR`). |
| `spool` | Dedicated to email sending. |

The root folder is also the place to include a `composer.json` file and the subsequent `/vendor` directory for managing dependencies.


## `lib`

The `lib` directory contains libraries and services used as external resources. These are core utilities and components that are shared across the framework. Examples include:

- **Core services**: Utilities for file manipulation, database interaction, and other low-level operations.

- **Shared classes**: Common classes used across multiple packages or modules.

- **Framework utilities**: Helper functions and classes that provide additional functionality to the framework.

## `packages`

The `packages` directory is the heart of the framework, containing all installed packages. Each package typically includes:

- **Actions**: Controllers and logic for handling specific tasks or API endpoints.

- **Views**: Templates and rendering logic for the user interface.

- **Translations**: Language files for internationalization.

- **Configurations**: Package-specific settings and initialization files.

- **Tests**: Unit tests for ensuring the package's functionality.

Packages are modular and can be added, removed, or updated independently, making the framework highly extensible.

## `public`

The `public` directory is the root folder for the web server. It contains files that are directly accessible by the client, such as:

- **`.htaccess`**: Configuration file for Apache servers to manage URL rewriting, access control, and other server settings.

- **`index.php`**: The main entry point for handling HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate controllers.

This directory is where static assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images) should be placed for client-side use.

## `bin`

The `bin` directory is used to store binary data, such as files uploaded by users or generated by the application. It is referenced by the `BINARY_STORAGE_DIR` constant in the framework configuration.

## `spool`

The `spool` directory is dedicated to email sending. It acts as a temporary storage area for emails that are queued for delivery. The framework processes these emails asynchronously to improve performance and reliability.

## Additional Notes

- **Composer Integration**: The framework supports Composer for dependency management. Place a `composer.json` file in the root directory to define dependencies, and the `/vendor` directory will be created to store them.

- **Extensibility**: The modular design of the `packages` directory allows developers to create and integrate new features without modifying the core framework.

- **Public Access**: Only the `public` directory should be exposed to the web server. All other directories should remain inaccessible for security reasons.
